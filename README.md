# Signal Fingerprinting Application

## Introduction
The Signal Fingerprinting Application identifies sound files based on intrinsic features extracted from their spectrograms. This tool is useful in various fields such as the music industry (identifying songs or singers) and medical diagnostics (recognizing arrhythmias in ECG signals).

## Features

### **1. Song Repository Creation**
- Each group contributes one song and splits it into:
  - Full song
  - Music
  - Vocals
- Files are uploaded to a shared repository with the following naming format:
  - `GroupX_SongName_Full`
  - `GroupX_SongName_Music`
  - `GroupX_SongName_Vocals`
- A shared sheet tracks song names to prevent duplication.

### **2. Spectrogram Generation**
- Generate spectrograms for the first 30 seconds of each file (full, music, vocals).
- Save spectrograms locally.

### **3. Feature Extraction and Fingerprinting**
- Extract key features from spectrograms and store them in a structured file.
- Use perceptual hashing to create compact fingerprints for fast comparisons.

### **4. Similarity Matching**
- Input any sound file (full, music, or vocals) to:
  - Generate its spectrogram and features.
  - Compare it against the repository.
  - Display similarity scores in a sorted table within the GUI.

### **5. File Mixing and Matching**
- Combine two files using weighted averages:
  - Adjust weights via a slider.
  - Treat the resulting file as new and perform similarity matching.

## Usage

1. **Song Repository Creation**:
   - Upload songs split into full, music, and vocals.
   - Ensure unique song entries in the shared repository.

2. **Spectrogram Generation**:
   - Automatically generate and save spectrograms for uploaded files.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract features and fingerprints for all spectrograms.

4. **Similarity Matching**:
   - Input a sound file to find the closest matches in the repository.

5. **File Mixing**:
   - Combine two files and match the resulting fingerprint to the repository.
